git-prune - Prunes all unreachable objects from the object database


SYNOPSIS

'git-prune' [-n] [--] [<head>...]

DESCRIPTION

This runs `git-fsck-objects --unreachable` using all the refs
available in `$GIT_DIR/refs`, optionally with additional set of
objects specified on the command line, and prunes all
objects unreachable from any of these head objects from the object database.
In addition, it
prunes the unpacked objects that are also found in packs by
running `git prune-packed`.

	Do not remove anything; just report what it would
	remove.

<head>...::
	In addition to objects
	reachable from any of our references, keep objects
	reachable from listed <head>s.

To prune objects not used by your repository nor another that
borrows from your repository via its
`.git/objects/info/alternates`:

------------
$ git prune $(cd ../another && $(git-rev-parse --all))
