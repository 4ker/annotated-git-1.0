==========

NAME
----
git-log - Show commit logs


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-log' <option>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the commit logs.  This command internally invokes
'git-rev-list', and the command line options are passed to that
command.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.

OPTIONS
-------
--pretty=<format>::
	Controls the way the commit log is formatted.

--max-count=<n>::
	Limits the number of commits to show.

<since>..<until>::
	Show only commits between the named two commits.


Examples
--------
git log --no-merges::

	Show the whole commit history, but skip any merges

git log v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi::

	Show all commits since version 'v2.6.12' that changed any file
	in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

git log --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk::

	Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file 'gitk'.
	The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the *branch* named
	'gitk'
