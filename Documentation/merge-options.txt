-n, \--no-summary::
	Do not show diffstat at the end of the merge.

--no-commit::

	not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and
	further tweak the merge result before committing.


-s <strategy>, \--strategy=<strategy>::
	Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
	once to specify them in the order they should be tried.

	head, `git-merge-octopus` otherwise).
