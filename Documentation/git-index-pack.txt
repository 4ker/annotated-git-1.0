=================

NAME
----
git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-index-pack' [-o <index-file>] <pack-file>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and
builds a pack index file (.idx) for it.  The packed archive
together with the pack index can then be placed in the
objects/pack/ directory of a git repository.


OPTIONS
-------
-o <index-file>::
	Write the generated pack index into the specified
	file.  Without this option the name of pack index
	file is constructed from the name of packed archive
	file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program
	fails if the name of packed archive does not end
	with .pack).
