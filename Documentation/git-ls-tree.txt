git-ls-tree(1)
==============

NAME
----
git-ls-tree - Lists the contents of a tree object.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-ls-tree' [-d] [-r] [-t] [-z] [--name-only] [--name-status] <tree-ish> [paths...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does
in the current working directory. Note that the usage is subtly different,
though - 'paths' denote just a list of patterns to match, e.g. so specifying
directory name (without '-r') will behave differently, and order of the
arguments does not matter.

OPTIONS
-------
<tree-ish>::
	Id of a tree-ish.

-d::
	Show only the named tree entry itself, not its children.

-r::
	Recurse into sub-trees.

-t::
	Show tree entries even when going to recurse them. Has no effect
	if '-r' was not passed. '-d' implies '-t'.

-z::
	\0 line termination on output.

--name-only::
--name-status::
	List only filenames (instead of the "long" output), one per line.

paths::
	When paths are given, show them (note that this isn't really raw
	pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to match).  Otherwise
	implicitly uses the root level of the tree as the sole path argument.


Output Format
-------------
        <mode> SP <type> SP <object> TAB <file>

When the `-z` option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters
in pathnames are represented as `\t`, `\n`, and `\\`, respectively.
