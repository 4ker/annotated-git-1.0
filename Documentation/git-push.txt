git-push(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-push - Update remote refs along with associated objects.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-push' [--all] [--force] <repository> <refspec>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
necessary to complete the given refs.

You can make "interesting" things to happen on the repository
every time you push into it, by setting up 'hooks' there.  See
documentation for gitlink:git-receive-pack[1].


OPTIONS
-------
include::pull-fetch-param.txt[]

\--all::
	Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies all refs
	to be pushed.

-f, \--force::
	Usually, the command refuses to update a local ref that is
	not an ancestor of the remote ref used to overwrite it.
	This flag disables the check.  What this means is that the
	local repository can lose commits; use it with care.
